# IoT-Embedded_Systems

The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) with sensors, processing ability, software, 
and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.
Internet of things has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected to the public internet, 
they only need to be connected to a network and be individually addressable.

The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, 
increasingly powerful embedded systems, and machine learning. Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, 
control systems, automation (including home and building automation), independently and collectively enable the Internet of things.
In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", including devices 
and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems, cameras, and other home appliances) that support one 
or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. 
IoT is also used in healthcare systems.


Embedded System

An embedded system is a computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system.[1][2] It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts. Because an embedded system typically controls physical operations of the machine that it is embedded within, it often has real-time computing constraints. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today.[3] In 2009, it was estimated that ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors manufactured were used in embedded systems.[4][needs update]

Modern embedded systems are often based on microcontrollers (i.e. microprocessors with integrated memory and peripheral interfaces), but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more complex systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in a certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the digital signal processor (DSP).

Since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase its reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from economies of scale.

Embedded systems range in size from portable personal devices such as digital watches and MP3 players to bigger machines like home appliances, industrial assembly lines, robots, transport vehicles, traffic light controllers, and medical imaging systems. Often they constitute subsystems of other machines like avionics in aircraft and astrionics in spacecraft. Large installations like factories, pipelines and electrical grids rely on multiple embedded systems networked together. Generalized through software customization, embedded systems such as programmable logic controllers frequently comprise their functional units.

Embedded systems range from those low in complexity, with a single microcontroller chip, to very high with multiple units, peripherals and networks, which may reside in equipment racks or across large geographical areas connected via long-distance communications lines.
